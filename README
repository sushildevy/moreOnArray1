Program:  prog6
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog6'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog6' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONp
   This program will read scores from a text file(testscores) containing max score, name and score obtained
   store them in parallel array, sort them descendingly,displays the names, scores, grade percentage and letter grade in 
   tabular form in textfile(testresults), maximum scores, highest scores,lowest score, range of the 
   scores, number of student proceed, mediam and standard deviation in a textfile(testsummary)
    

PROGRAM INPUT
    input is from text file named "testscores".
  
   
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is produced in a text files . The output will be tabular form of names, scores(array 
   of ints), respected  grade and letter grades where scores are arranged descendingly in testresults 
   and followed by a summary of maximum scores, highest scores,lowest score, range of the 
   scores, number of student proceed, mediam and standard deviation in testsummaryS.

PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program stores all the ints in an array.

   The general algorithm
      read the ints into an array
      sort the array descendingly
      output name, scores, percentage and grades
      output the summary

   Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
   be found in the documentation for each file.

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested with different sets of testscores.  

   Checked for a normal set of data (0 - mmaximum score )
   
   Checked for the number of values exceeding the array size and 
   exceeding maximum scores 
   
   Checked for input of 1 value and the sentinel

   Checked for input of just the sentinel

   There are no known bugs.  Any errors should be reported to:
